# Address Locator
Converts an address into latitude and longitude co-ordinates.

The class library does all the heavy lifting, but a sample console app is
included to demonstrate finding an address using OpenStreetMap. Please update
the dummy email address in the console app to your own email address to play
nicely with the OSM API!
